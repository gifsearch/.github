## Gif Search

**Gif Search** is a Telegram bot for rapid information retrieval via DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia. No API keys required — just instant results from open sources with snippet extraction and Wikipedia prioritization.

The project is fully open-source under the MIT license, written in Python with Docker support, and ready for one-command deployment. It works in private chats and groups, maintains statistics in SQLite, and provides an admin panel for monitoring.
